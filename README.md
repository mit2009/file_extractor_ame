# File Extractor for AME

Extracts files from a nested directory structure to a flat directory structure, renaming them to maintain the structure. This is so that you can set the extracted directory as a watch folder in Adobe Media Encoder and encode everything all at once. Note that for >50 files, AME becomes sad and unstable and you should monitor it every few hours. Learn from my experience.
